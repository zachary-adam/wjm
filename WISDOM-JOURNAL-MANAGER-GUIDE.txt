Wisdom Journal Manager — Complete User Guide
Version 1.0.0 | By Aethex (http://aethexweb.com)
Built by: Maaz Ahmad, Shariq Hashme
=======================================================


INTRODUCTION
------------
Wisdom Journal Manager is the World's First Affordable Journal Manager for WordPress. It gives universities, research departments, and independent publishers a complete academic publishing platform — covering the full hierarchy of Journals, Issues, Papers, and Authors — with editorial workflow, automated citation tracking, and enterprise-grade security.

This guide covers everything from initial installation to day-to-day editorial operations.


WHO SHOULD READ THIS GUIDE
---------------------------
- Editors-in-Chief and Managing Editors
- Section and Guest Editors
- Copy/Layout Editors
- Reviewers
- Authors submitting or managing papers
- Site Administrators managing the plugin
- Developers extending or customizing the plugin


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- WordPress 5.0 or higher (tested up to 6.7)
- PHP 7.4 or higher (with curl and json extensions)
- MySQL 5.6 or higher (or compatible MariaDB)
- Server memory: 256 MB minimum, 512 MB recommended
- HTTPS strongly recommended for all admin work


INSTALLATION
------------
1. In WordPress Admin, go to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
2. Select the plugin ZIP file and click Install Now.
3. Click Activate Plugin.
4. Go to Journals → Plugin Verification to confirm all components are working.
5. Go to Journals → User Roles to assign roles to your team.
6. Optionally, go to Journals → Automation to configure API keys and citation updates.

To upgrade: deactivate the old version, upload the new ZIP, and reactivate.
Always back up your database and files before upgrading.

To uninstall: deactivating keeps all your data intact.
Deleting via the Plugins page removes plugin settings and scheduled tasks;
your content (journals, issues, papers, authors) remains in the database.


10-MINUTE QUICK START
---------------------
1. Go to Journals → Add New — create your first Journal (title, ISSN, publisher, editors).
2. Go to Issues → Add New — create an Issue linked to your Journal (year, volume/number).
3. Go to Papers → Add New — add a Paper (title, authors, DOI if available, PDF link).
4. Go to Authors — create Author profiles and link them to papers.
5. Create a WordPress Page and add [journals] to display your journal listing.
6. Go to Journals → Automation and enable citation updates.


WHERE TO FIND EVERYTHING (ADMIN MENU)
--------------------------------------
Journals → Journals          List and manage all journals
Journals → Add New           Create a new journal
Journals → Issues            List and manage all issues
Journals → Papers            List and manage all papers
Journals → Authors           Author profiles and directory
Journals → Automation        Citation/view update settings and manual runs
Journals → Security Log      Security event audit trail
Journals → Rate Limits       View usage and remaining quotas
Journals → Plugin Verification  Self-check panel for all plugin components
Journals → Import/Export     Data migration and backup tools


HOW YOUR DATA IS ORGANIZED
---------------------------
The plugin uses a clean three-level hierarchy:

  Journals  (top level — the publication brand)
      └── Issues  (publication units — volume/number or special issues)
              └── Papers  (the scholarly content)

Authors are separate profiles linked to papers with order and corresponding-author designation.

This hierarchy enables:
- Filtering papers by journal, issue, author, year, keyword, or type
- Correct breadcrumb navigation on each single-view page
- Clean relationships in import/export and automation


USER ROLES AND PERMISSIONS
---------------------------
The plugin creates four custom roles alongside standard WordPress roles:

Role                    | Capabilities
------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
Journal Editor-in-Chief | Full editorial control over all journals and issues
Journal Editor          | Manage issues and papers; run automation
Journal Reviewer        | Read and review access
Journal Author          | Submit and manage own papers

Rate limits (API calls and data fetches per hour) are role-based:
  Student        50 API calls, 30 data fetches/hour
  Researcher    100 API calls, 60 data fetches/hour
  Editor        200 API calls, 120 data fetches/hour
  Administrator 500 API calls, 300 data fetches/hour

Typical paper lifecycle:
  Submission → Under Review → Decision → Revisions → Accepted → Copy/Layout → Published

Tracking: Update the paper's Submission Status field as it moves through stages.
Each status change is recorded in Tracking History with a timestamp and optional notes.

Best practices:
  - Keep decision notes concise and factual.
  - Record acceptance and publication dates accurately — they appear on the frontend.
  - Use the Corrections/Errata field for any post-publication changes.
  - Assign the correct editors and reviewers at the Issue level so they appear on the issue page.


AUTOMATION AND ACADEMIC API INTEGRATIONS
-----------------------------------------
Location: Journals → Automation

Purpose: Automatically retrieve citation counts and metadata for your papers from academic databases.

Supported sources:
  CrossRef           Free; uses DOI to fetch citation data. Best for DOI-assigned papers.
  Semantic Scholar   Free; searches by title and author.
  arXiv              Free; for preprint and cross-listed papers.
  Scopus             Premium; requires API key from Elsevier.
  Web of Science     Premium; requires API key from Clarivate.

Setup:
  1. Go to Journals → Automation.
  2. Toggle "Enable Automation" to on.
  3. Select your update frequency (daily, weekly, monthly).
  4. Select which sources to use.
  5. For Scopus or Web of Science, enter your API key and click Save.
     Keys are encrypted before storage and never displayed in plain text.
  6. Click "Update All Papers" to run a manual update immediately.

Per-paper updates:
  Open any paper's edit screen and click "Update This Paper"
  to fetch fresh data for just that paper.

Reliability:
  - API timeouts and errors are handled gracefully; failed updates are logged.
  - Existing local data is preserved unless the incoming data is valid and newer.
  - Rate limits protect your site and the API providers.


FRONTEND SHORTCODES

Place these shortcodes on any WordPress Page or Post.

[journals]
  Display all journals.

[journals layout="grid|list" publisher="Aethex" open_access="1" peer_reviewed="1" year="2020" per_page="12"]

FRONTEND SINGLE-VIEW PAGES
---------------------------
Each custom post type has an automatically generated single-view page:

Journal page:  Displays journal info, editorial board, and a list of issues.
Issue page:    Displays issue metadata, editorial team, and papers in this issue.
Paper page:    Displays full paper details — abstract, metadata grid, author cards,
               download buttons, version history, compliance info, and license.
Author page:   Displays the author's profile — bio, affiliation, ORCID, and publications.

All single-view pages include:
- Breadcrumb navigation (e.g. Journals > Journal Name > Issue > Paper Title)
- Clean minimal academic design (white background, blue accent)
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile

The plugin loads its CSS only on these pages, not sitewide.


IMPORT AND EXPORT
-----------------
Location: Journals → Import/Export

Export:
  Select the content type (Journals, Issues, or Papers) and format (CSV, JSON, XML).
  Click Export to download the file.

Import:
  1. Download the sample template for the content type you want to import.
  2. Fill in the template with your data.
  3. Upload the completed file and click Import.
  4. Required fields are validated; errors are reported per row.

Tips:
  - Import journals before issues; import issues before papers (to satisfy relationships).
  - Use batches of 50–100 rows on hosts with limited PHP memory.
  - Increase PHP upload_max_filesize and post_max_size for larger files.


SECURITY: WHAT THE PLUGIN DOES TO PROTECT YOU
-----------------------------------------------
* All inputs are validated and sanitized before storage.
* All outputs are escaped for their HTML context before display.
* All form submissions are protected with CSRF nonces.
* All database queries use prepared statements (no SQL injection risk).
* API keys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC using WordPress secret keys/salts.
  They are never stored or displayed in plain text.
* Every admin action verifies the current user has the required capability.
* High-cost operations (API calls, data fetches) are rate-limited by role.
* All security events are logged at Journals → Security Log with severity,
  user, IP address, and timestamp.

Recommended practices:
  - Run WordPress over HTTPS.
  - Keep WordPress core, PHP, and all plugins updated.
  - Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for admin accounts.
  - Review the Security Log regularly for unusual activity.
  - Restrict admin access by IP where possible.


PLUGIN VERIFICATION
--------------------
Location: Journals → Plugin Verification

Runs a self-check on all plugin components:
- Custom post types registered correctly
- Database tables present and correctly structured
- Meta boxes loading without errors
- Shortcodes registered
- CSS and JS assets present
- Automation system reachable

Run this after installation or after an upgrade to confirm everything is working.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: Journals menu not visible.
Fix: Confirm your WordPress user has at least Editor capabilities.
     Check Journals → User Roles for your role assignment.

Problem: "Attempt to read property 'ID' on null" notice.
Fix: Open Papers via Journals → Papers rather than a direct post URL.
     This is handled in the current version.

Problem: Citations not updating.
Fix: 1. Enable Automation at Journals → Automation.
     2. Verify API credentials are saved (re-enter and save if unsure).
     3. Check Journals → Rate Limits — wait for the hourly reset if limits are exceeded.
     4. Check Journals → Security Log for blocked or failed requests.

Problem: Import fails.
Fix: Download the sample template and compare your file's headers exactly.
     Ensure all required fields are present.
     Try a smaller batch (50 rows).
     Check PHP upload_max_filesize with your hosting provider.

Problem: Frontend pages have no styling.
Fix: The plugin CSS loads only on journal/issue/paper/author pages, not globally.
     If your theme overrides styles, add more specific CSS rules in your theme's
     custom CSS area (use .sjm-single-container as a parent selector).

Problem: API keys show as invalid after saving.
Fix: Keys are encrypted on save. Re-enter the key in full and save again.
     Check that your server can reach the API domain (no firewall/proxy blocks).


PERFORMANCE TIPS
----------------
- Enable page caching (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, etc.) for shortcode listing pages.
- Set automation frequency to weekly unless daily updates are critical.
- Use shortcode filters and pagination — avoid loading 500 papers on one page.
- Use the subject area and year filters when browsing large journal portfolios.
- The author table (wp_sjm_authors) is separate from WordPress posts for fast queries.


PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE
-----------------------
- Data stored: journals, issues, papers, author profiles, security logs.
- External requests: only to selected academic APIs (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, arXiv,
  and optionally Scopus/Web of Science). Requests come from your server, not from user browsers.
- No telemetry: the plugin does not send usage data anywhere.
- To handle data subject requests (GDPR/privacy), use WordPress built-in tools:
  Tools → Export Personal Data and Tools → Erase Personal Data.
- Publish a site-level privacy notice describing what author and user data you collect.
